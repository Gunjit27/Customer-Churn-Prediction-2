# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on various customer-related parameters. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is "CustomerChurnData.csv." It contains various customer attributes, such as contract type, monthly charges, total charges, and customer demographics.

## Data Preprocessing
- Initial data exploration and analysis are performed.
- Data is cleaned by handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature engineering is applied to extract meaningful features.
- Categorical features are encoded, and numerical features are scaled.
- The target variable is handled to balance the dataset.

## Model
A machine learning model is constructed using popular libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, with the following components:
- Data preprocessing pipelines.
- A choice of classifier algorithms, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Neural Networks.
- Hyperparameter tuning if necessary.

The choice of classifier may vary depending on your dataset and problem.

## Training
The model is trained on the preprocessed data using a train-test split. Cross-validation may also be employed for model selection and tuning.

## Evaluation
The trained model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can modify this based on your specific business requirements.

## Usage
You can use this code to predict customer churn based on your own dataset. Make sure to install the required libraries and modify the code as needed. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install the necessary libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Modify the data file path and model parameters in the code.
4. Run the code to train and evaluate the model.

## Dependencies
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (if using neural networks)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploring and visualizing data)

You can install these dependencies using `pip` or your preferred package manager.
